# CardGame

This is a work in progress. It is a spinoff of the game Dominion, a deckbuilding game in which players use cards to buy more cards to add to their deck. The difference is that there are locations that a player must take control of in order to buy more cards, including loyalty cards which are necessary to win the game. This forces more player interaction, which the original game was lacking.

I am currently adding a matchmaking lobby using HTML and CSS. I plan to implement websockets in the near future so that the game can be played remotely.
