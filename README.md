# CardGame

This is a work in progress. It is a spinoff of the game Dominion, in that is a deckbuilding game where players use cards to buy more cards to add to their deck. The change is that there are locations that a player must take control of in order to buy more cards, including loyalty cards which are necessary to win the game.

I am currently adding a matchmaking lobby using HTML and CSS. I plan to implement websockets in the near future so that the game can be played remotely.
